	<div class="mb-4">
		<h3>It's a Tabletop RPG!</h3>
		<p>A tabletop role-playing game (or pen-and-paper role-playing game) is a form of role-playing game (RPG) in which the participants describe their characters' actions through speech. Participants determine the actions of their characters based on their characterization,<sup>[1]</sup> and the actions succeed or fail according to a set formal system of rules and guidelines. Within the rules, players have the freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the game.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

		<h3>The Setting</h3>
		<p>Battleborn is a fantasy based game where magic and conflict are as common as the water in the oceans. Multiple gods, good and evil, rule from afar, only interfering when their interest is peaked by the mortals beneath them. Cities, large and small, scatter the planet. Some filled with just a few people, others number by the thousands.</p>
